# Password Complexity Checker

 Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

## Step 1: Define Password Strength Criteria

We need to establish what makes a password strong. Here are common criteria:

Length: A minimum number of characters (e.g., at least 8 characters).<br>

Uppercase Letters: Presence of at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).<br>

Lowercase Letters: Presence of at least one lowercase letter (a-z).<br>

Numbers: Presence of at least one digit (0-9).<br>

Special Characters: Presence of at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $).<br>

## Step 2: Create a Function to Check Each Criterion
We'll create separate functions to check if a password meets each of the above criteria.<br>

## Step 3: Combine Checks to Assess Overall Strength
Now, let's create a function that uses the above checks to determine the password strength. We'll give feedback based on how many criteria are met.

## Step 4: Provide Feedback to the User
Finally, we need a way to get the password from the user and provide the feedback. Hereâ€™s how we can do that in a simple script.
